# Diseased-Daisyworld
An agent based extension of the Watson and Lovelock model. Daisyworld is a world made up of daisies. It is able to maintain
homoeostasis by balancing the number of black and white daisies. With an increasing solar radiation, Daisyworld is able to 
simulate how the global environment is affected by climate change. I added the perturbation of a virtual pathogenic bacterium,
to test how disease can effect the global environment, in the face of climate change.
